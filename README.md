The datafiles contain raw data used in the publication "eDNA based bycatch assessment in pelagic fish catches", Scientific Reports. 
The file experimental_data_raw.RData contains data from the two experiments (March and November) performed to establish the biomass-to-eDNA relationship. 
The file on_site_test_sample_results.RData contains data from the on-site tests performed at landing facilities. These on-site test samples were used to decide which model (March or November) to use to most accurately translate the eDNA fractions to weight fractions at each landing.
